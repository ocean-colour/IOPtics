# PML follow-up list — AMT24 / MOANA reproduction

**Prepared:** 2026-08-16 (Claude, for JXP — consolidating every PML-bound item
from `claude_prompts/moana_prompts.md` Q&A #25, #27–31, #35)
**Context for the recipients:** we received the AMT24 HyperSAS Level-2 delivery
(37 daily directories, ~1 M spectra, `LT`/`LI`/`ES`/`RRS` as daily CSVs + IDL
`.sav`) and are reimplementing the Lange et al. (2020) / NASA PACE MOANA
algorithm from it. Everything below arose from a full inspection of that
delivery. Likely contacts: **Bob Brewin** (supplied the data), **Gavin
Tilstone**, **Giorgio Dall'Olmo**, **Tim Smyth** (AMT24 optics team / PI), and
**Glen Tarran** (flow cytometry).

Ordered by how much each item blocks the science.

## 1. The underway flow-cytometry samples (→ Tarran) — *highest priority*

The BODC deposit (DOI `10.5285/a2104adc-e98f-6789-e053-6c86abc0d557`) contains
**CTD-bottle samples only**: 814 samples at 68 stations, all `Gear=CTD`. But
Lange et al. (2020) trained MOANA on n = 73–78 samples **including the
~30-minute underway flow-cytometry sampling** across the South Atlantic Gyre
front — and their own sensitivity test (their Table 2) shows the underway
samples are what make the *Synechococcus* model work (CTD-only retraining
degrades Syn MAE from 1.27 to 1.37).

**Ask:** are the AMT24 underway FCM cell counts (Pro / Syn / picoeukaryotes)
available — as a second BODC deposit we may have missed, or directly? Without
them, any retraining is confined to the degraded CTD-only configuration.

### Update 2026-09-07 — the re-delivery does not contain them

A second copy of the AMT24 AFC deposit arrived as
`$OS_COLOR/AMT/AMT24/AMT24_JR20140922_6param/` (`AMT24_AFC.out`,
`AMT24_JR20140922_AFC_Dataset.xlsx`, metadata report, flag key). **It is the
same data as the deposit we already had, not a superset.** Verified rather than
assumed:

- the `.xlsx` has a single sheet (`botlist`), 814 rows × 29 columns;
- 68 stations, **all `Gear=CTD`, all `ODV_type=b`**;
- joined on `BODC_bot`, **all six taxon columns are numerically identical**
  to `AMT24_JR20140922_AFC_Dataset.csv` (Pro, Syn, picoeuk, crypto, cocco,
  nanoeuk — `np.allclose` on every column);
- only the container (`.out`/`.xlsx` vs `.csv`) and the timestamp format
  (ISO vs `dd/mm/yyyy`) differ.

**Why re-requesting this DOI can never deliver the underway samples.** The
deposit is structurally a *bottle* product — its own metadata calls it a
"Bottle Retrieval Data Report", and every row is keyed by `BODC_bot` with
`Rosette_Pos` and `Firing_Seq`. Underway samples have no bottle, no rosette
position and no firing sequence, so they cannot be represented in this series
at all. They would have to be **a separate BODC series** (underway /
non-bottle) or come **directly from Glen Tarran**. Re-checked on 2026-09-07:
DataCite still returns exactly **one** AMT24 flow-cytometry DOI — the bottle
one — so no underway deposit exists to be found.

**The sharpened ask (→ Tarran).** What we need is the ~30-minute underway
flow-cytometry run across the South Atlantic Gyre front (roughly 25–45° S;
Lange et al. 2020 §2.1 and their Fig. 2b): *Prochlorococcus*,
*Synechococcus* and autotrophic picoeukaryote abundances in cells mL⁻¹, with a
UTC timestamp and latitude/longitude per sample. **A spreadsheet or plain CSV
is entirely sufficient** — this does not need to be a BODC deposit for us to
use it. Roughly 40–50 samples would take us from our present n = 30 to Lange's
n = 73–78.

**What it is worth, quantified.** Our full-fit *Synechococcus* MAE on the
CTD-only configuration is **1.36**, which lands essentially on Lange's own
CTD-only figure of **1.37** (their Table 2), against **1.27** with the underway
samples included. So the missing data is not a nuisance — it is measurably the
whole gap between our reproduction and theirs, and it is the one item that
would let us test Table 1 as an equality rather than an inequality.

### Update 2026-09-10 — Tom's reply answers a different question; suggested re-ask

Tom replied: *"the cell counts are the final set of columns in
`AMT24_JR20140922_AFC_Dataset.xlsx`, and these 'number codes' map onto the meta
data definitions in `AMT24_AFC_BODC_sample_metadata_report.html`. e.g. P700A90Z is
Abundance of Synechococcus"*.

**That is correct, and it is already exactly what we do** — so the request has
been misheard as "we cannot find the cell counts" when it is "we cannot find the
*underway* cell counts". Checked on receipt:

- the metadata report defines exactly **six** codes, and the workbook carries
  exactly those six columns — nothing is hidden or extra;
- our reader's mapping (`ioptics/moana/io.py:FCM_CODES`) is identical code for
  code, `P700A90Z → Synechococcus` and `P701A90Z → Prochlorococcus` included;
- the values we load match the workbook **cell for cell** (`np.allclose` per
  column, 810–812 finite samples each).

So there is no decoding problem, and no data in that file we are failing to use.
The gap is *which samples exist*, and it is visible in the file itself:

| | this deposit | Lange et al. (2020) |
|---|---|---|
| sampling mode | 814 bottles, **all `Gear=CTD`** | CTD casts **+ ~30-min underway run** |
| surface samples (≤ 10 m) | **68**, one per station | — |
| time of day | bimodal at 03–06 h and 12–15 h UTC (the two daily casts) | plus continuous daylight underway |
| in the 25–45° S front band | **16 samples**, median **14.9 h** / 1.11° (~66 nM) apart | ~30 min apart |
| usable for training | n = 30 (those with daylight radiometry) | n = 73–78 |

The 25–45° S row is the crux: that band is exactly where Lange et al. §2.1 and
their Fig. 2b describe the 30-minute underway sampling, and where their Table 2
shows it is what makes the *Synechococcus* model work. This deposit has 16 samples
there, roughly 15 hours apart.

**Suggested re-ask (wording matters here — please lead with the first sentence):**

One useful by-product of the exchange: the code→taxon mapping is now confirmed by
the data originators, not just inferred by us from the metadata document. That is
recorded at `ioptics/moana/io.py:FCM_CODES`.

## 2. Bug report: the ES CSVs in the Level-2 delivery are wrong

`AMT24_HSAS_<day>_ES.dat` is a **byte-identical copy** of
`AMT24_HSAS_<day>_LT.dat` on **all 37 days** (verified by `md5sum`) — the
export evidently wrote the LT matrix twice. The true downwelling irradiance is
intact inside the `.sav` files (`matrix_es`: ~90–175 µW cm⁻² nm⁻¹, correct
solar shape), so nothing is lost — but anyone using the CSVs alone would
compute Rrs with radiance in place of irradiance.

**Ask:** none needed for us (we read the `.sav`); flagged so PML can fix the
export before the delivery goes to anyone else.

## 3. Two missing days inside the MOANA training window

The delivery covers DOY 266–305 (2014) but **DOY 267, 273 and 298 are absent**.
Lange's training window is 30 Sep – 1 Nov = DOY 273–305, so **273 (30 Sep) and
298 (25 Oct)** are real holes: any flow-cytometry samples on those days lose
their radiometry matchup.

**Ask:** do those days exist (instrument up, files just not exported), or was
the HyperSAS down? If they exist, please include them.

## 4. Processing-chain documentation for the Level-2 delivery

The delivery came with no README. We reverse-engineered the processing
empirically and would like it confirmed or corrected:

- shipped `RRS` = `(LT − 0.0280·LI)/ES` exactly — fixed Mobley ρ, applied
  per-spectrum at ~0.86 s cadence;
- **no** NIR-residual/glint-offset subtraction (median Rrs(750–796 nm)
  ≈ 0.0020 sr⁻¹);
- **no** tilt/azimuth/solar-zenith screening and **no** time binning;
- spectra already resampled to a uniform 306–796 nm @ 3.5 nm grid
  (HyperOCR native is ~3.3 nm, non-uniform);
- units: ES in µW cm⁻² nm⁻¹, LT/LI in µW cm⁻² nm⁻¹ sr⁻¹;
- ancillary SST/salinity columns are corrupt on DOY 266 (pre-departure).

**Ask:** a one-page note (or email) stating the calibration applied (pre/post
cruise averaging?), the dark treatment, the resampling, and anything else
between raw HyperSAS and these files.

## 5. Native-resolution spectra (lower priority)

Because the delivery is already interpolated once (native ~3.3 nm → uniform
3.5 nm), reaching MOANA's 414–660 nm @ 2 nm grid forces a second interpolation.
We accept the small smoothing for now (Q&A #31).

**Ask (when convenient):** the native-grid Level-2 spectra, to remove one
interpolation from the chain.

## 6. Lange et al.'s processed training matrix (if PML holds it)

The cleanest possible reproduction target is the **processed 414–660 nm @ 2 nm
Rrs matrix that was actually fed to `prcomp`** in Lange et al. (2020) — their
glint minimisation, screening and noise filtering differ from anything
derivable from the Level-2 delivery without re-implementing it (which we are
doing, but exact reproduction of their PCA needs their exact matrix).
Priscila Lange processed it, but the underlying data and possibly the
processing scripts are PML's.

**Ask:** does PML hold that matrix (or the processing code), and can it be
shared for reproduction purposes?

## 7. Encourage a BODC deposit of the AMT24 radiometry

BODC already publishes AMT in-situ hyperspectral Rrs for **AMT23, 25, 26, 28**
(Brewin et al. 2023, DOI `10.5285/f3198e10-faf3-1525-e053-6c86abc0d2f6`) —
same data type, same programme, same group. AMT24 is the *training cruise of an
operational NASA PACE product* and its radiometry is currently unpublished
(we verified: no SeaBASS, no DataCite, no BODC series).

**Ask/suggestion:** depositing the AMT24 radiometry (this Level-2 set or
better) with BODC would make MOANA reproducible from public data for the first
time.

*Not for PML:* the algorithm-side questions (PC-mapping discrepancy, PCA
eigenvalues, regression covariance, the paper-vs-ATBD SST term for
picoeukaryotes) go to the NASA/MOANA authors — that list lives in
`reports/MOANA_Claude_Report.md` §11.
