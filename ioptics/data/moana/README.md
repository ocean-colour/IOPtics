# MOANA reference tables (vendored from NASA OCSSW)

These two files are the **complete** set of tunable constants behind the NASA
MOANA algorithm (Multiple Ordination ANAlysis), which returns near-surface cell
abundances of *Prochlorococcus*, *Synechococcus* and autotrophic picoeukaryotes
from hyperspectral `Rrs` plus SST.

They are vendored here deliberately: neither file is published in Lange et al.
(2020) nor in the MOANA ATBD, so without them the algorithm cannot be run at all.
They are small (24 KB + 390 B) and NASA pins them to a 2023 OCSSW tag, so keeping
a copy in-repo makes our results reproducible without an 11 GB OCSSW install.

## `pca_picophyto.h5` — the PCA loadings

HDF5, 24,488 bytes, two datasets:

| Dataset | Shape | dtype | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `component` | (124, 45) | float32 | loading matrix `V[λ, i]`; 45 retained principal components |
| `wavelength` | (124,) | int32 | 414, 416, …, 660 nm (2 nm steps) |

`V`'s columns are orthonormal (`max |offdiag(VᵀV)| = 1.2e-7`), i.e. a properly
truncated eigenvector basis. PC1 is a smooth blue→red ramp (max +0.171 at 414 nm,
min −0.097 at 658 nm), consistent with Lange et al.'s description of PC1 as
backscatter slope plus pure-water absorption.

The 414–660 nm / 2 nm grid here is authoritative and resolves a contradiction in
the ATBD, whose abstract instead claims a 395–705 nm requirement.

## `picophyt.json` — the regression coefficients

```json
{ "npc": "17",
  "pro_coef":   "…19 values…",
  "syn_coef":   "…18 values…",
  "apeuk_coef": "…18 values…" }
```

Vectors are **zero-padded**: their lengths (19, 18, 18) match the OCSSW C
allocations `npc+2`, `npc+1`, `npc+1` with `npc = 17`, so coefficient slot *k*
maps to a fixed principal component. Only the first `npc = 17` scores are used,
even though 45 are stored and computed.

Slot → PC mapping, as consumed by `get_Cpicophyt.c`:

- `pro_coef[0]` = intercept, `pro_coef[1]` = coefficient on `log10(SST)`,
  `pro_coef[i+2]` multiplies score `U_(i+1)`
- `syn_coef[0]` = intercept, `syn_coef[i+1]` multiplies `U_(i+1)`
- `apeuk_coef[0]` = intercept, `apeuk_coef[i+1]` multiplies `U_(i+1)`

## Known inconsistency (read before using)

Decoding `picophyt.json` through the mapping above and comparing with the ATBD
v1.2 equations:

| Taxon | PCs per this file (operational) | PCs per ATBD v1.2 |
|---|---|---|
| *Prochlorococcus* | 1, 2, 6, **7** | 1, 2, 6, **17** |
| *Synechococcus* | 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, **16** | 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, **13** |
| picoeukaryotes | 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 15 | identical ✓ |

All coefficient *values* agree (to ATBD rounding). Only the PC index of the last
*Prochlorococcus* and last *Synechococcus* term differs. The ATBD's assignment
spans **14** distinct PCs across the three taxa — matching Lange et al.'s
statement that 14 PCs survived the significance cut — whereas this file spans
**15**. That is evidence the operational table may have two coefficients in the
wrong slots, i.e. the shipping PACE products may not implement the published
algorithm. Unconfirmed by the authors as of 2026-08-01.

Our implementation therefore supports **both** mappings behind a flag, with the
operational (this file's) mapping as the default so we can reproduce NASA's
products bit-for-bit.

## Algorithm summary

Per spectrum: linearly interpolate `Rrs` onto the 124-point grid → standardize
across wavelength, `(Rrs − mean)/sd` with the **sample (N−1)** denominator → take
scores `U_i = Σ_λ V[λ,i]·Rrs'[λ]` (a plain dot product; there is **no** training
mean to subtract) → evaluate the three regressions. *Prochlorococcus* is linear in
cells mL⁻¹ and needs `log10(SST)`; the other two are `log10`-transformed and are
exponentiated afterwards.
