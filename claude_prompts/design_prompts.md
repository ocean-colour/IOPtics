# Design IOPtics

## Goals

We wish to generate a document that describes the design of IOPtics and its requirements.  This Repository will be used to test a wide range of IOP (inherent optical properties) algorithms.  We will generate metrics and diagnostics to share with the community.

We expect the package to do at least the following:

- Run a wide range of IOP algorithms on Rrs spectra
- Calculate IOP values and their uncertainties
   - absorption spectra (a), separated by water, CDOM, etc.
   - backscattering spectra (bb), separated by water, CDOM, etc.
- Compare the results of the algorithms with ground truth values
   - Using simulated spectra
   - Using in-situ measurements
- Share the results with the community
- Generate reports and publications on the main findings

## Claude

### Skills

Consider using the skills in .claude/skills/

## Context

Examine the following files that may help generating the design:

- The code and files in the BING Repository: https://github.com/ocean-colour/BING.  There is a local copy on this computer
- The docs/context.md file in this repository

## Prompts

### Context

- The Ocean Optics book, currently located in docs/PDFs/mobley-oceanicopticsbook.pdf
- The GIOP publication by Werdell+2013.  I have placed it in docs/PDFs/werdell_2013.pdf
- The review paper by Werdell+2018.  I have placed it in docs/PDFs/werdell2018.pdf

1. Read the Context section above.  Read the files in the BING Repository and the Ocean Optics book.  Generate a docs/context.md file that you can refer to which is a reduced form of the information in the files.  Add a version number and date to the file.  Log your work in the Logs section below.

## Overview

Guidelines for the design document which will be named IOPtics_dashboard_design.md and will be stored in docs/design/.  Keep in mind:

- You are encouraged to suggest your own design ideas 
- This document will be used to guide the development of the IOPtics package
- It will not include specific code recommendations; we will generate a separate doc for that

### Prep

1. Start the design document by including a preamble of what it is for.  Title that section "Preamble".

   - Add any other information you think is relevant
   - Add a version number to the document (0.1)
   - Add a date to the document (today's date)
   - Add a author to the document (JXP and Claude)

## Data

The following will describe several of the inital datasets to be used in IOPtics.

### The Hydrolight dataset provided by Loisel+2023, aka L23

Unless otherwise specified, these data are located in $OS_COLOR/Loisel2023

I have included a copy of their paper in docs/PDFs/Loisel_et_al_ESSD_2023.pdf

These are simulated spectra, so we know the ground truth values for the IOPs.

The API to load these data is provided through ocpy/ocpy/hydrolight/loisel23.py

### NOMAD dataset

## Logging

The "Logs" section will record Claude's work.  Please use the following format:

### <Date> (Short summary of the work)

<Detailed description of the work and what you learned>
